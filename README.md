# charmore

Charmore is an autoregressive character-level language model that is
similar to **Andrej Karpathy's [makemore][makemore-link]**. The model
is based on n-grams and can generate words similar to the training set.
Initially, it is trained on a [Nordic][nordic-name-data] names dataset.

The project is built for educational purposes and for the journey of learning
language models.
